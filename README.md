# 🌾 AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System

An intelligent Machine Learning project that recommends the **most suitable crop** based on **soil nutrients**, **weather**, and **environmental conditions**.  
This system uses data science and a trained ML model to provide actionable agricultural insights to help farmers and agri-tech enthusiasts make better decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **ETL Pipeline:** Preprocessed and structured raw agricultural datasets (soil, weather, and climate data).  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized soil nutrient distributions and environmental patterns affecting crop growth.  
- 🤖 **ML Models:** Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers to predict the optimal crop with up to **98% accuracy**.  
- 🔁 **Prompt Chaining (AI Layer):** Interactive Streamlit app that refines crop suggestions based on user prompts (e.g., “increase rainfall by 50”).  
- 🌐 **Streamlit Interface:** Simple, user-friendly dashboard for farmers and researchers.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Streamlit**
- **pickle**
